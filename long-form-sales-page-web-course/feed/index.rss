					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re article - your work on this - is WAW awesome incredible fantastic. As Ramona said it helps me so much.

You&#039;re analysis is precise with points that show you know what you&#039;re talking about.

I benefit from it and from the link with Noah Kagan.

Thank you. Sincerely. I wish you all the best.

I am not in the field of webmarketing so this type of post really helps. It&#039;s like the Ultimate Guide to Building Sales Page like a Pro.

I improve my sales page from what you write. Especially with the different plans and the 19th point about demonstrability of the product.

I don&#039;t know yet when I&#039;ll be able to do my launch but I want to come back to tell you the results with my brand new sales page and I&#039;m gonna to look forward to know your work.

Thanks again !

					<description><![CDATA[I was actually trying to study their pages (Ramit&#039;s especially, I think he&#039;s crazy good with this type of stuff), but it&#039;s so much to take into, especially for someone who&#039;s now learning marketing ..

Your article really came at the right moment, since it pin-pointed EXACTLY where I can improve.

I was able to sell few tens of spots for my freelancing course, but I do feel there&#039;s way more potential and I&#039;d love to make more sells (of course).

Really appreciate ALL the tremendous work you&#039;re doing here and can&#039;t wait for more insights like these. I&#039;m a &#039;convert&#039; for YLPS right now]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, sounds like that&#039;s right up your alley!

There&#039;s definitely a LOT you can learn from these guys, I could have made that article a loooot longer if I&#039;d started digging into the details, that&#039;s why I included the full landing pages along with it. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, incredible insights. Have been reading your articles for 2 hours already and I&#039;m in awe. I try to sell a very small freelance course and this will help me tremendously. Now I&#039;ll go to sleep (it&#039;s midnight here) and tomorrow I&#039;ll start making changes. Really appreciate all the great content here and the ebook is a killer as well :)]]></description>
