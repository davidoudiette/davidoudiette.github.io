I am also saying that because these are the things that actually MATTER, all in one place! With the actual reactions of the author, in plain self-centered English we can all understand and identify with :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a start-up applying for Y-combinator&#039;s Summer 2016 batch, I came across this article at a very valuable time. We&#039;re constantly a/b testing different versions of our landing page to see what works best. Right now we&#039;re running the best performing version to date. However, this article uncovered at least 8 more things we can change and refine in some way. Thanks, David!]]></description>
